# Systems Programming

### What is it and how does it relate to games?

> Our Systems team is in charge of a lot of stuff:
>
> - Math Library
> - STD Replacement Library
> - Core Game Framework
> - Core Application Framework
> - Input
> - Event messaging
> - Component-Entity systems
> - Script binding
> - (and more)
>
> There's a lot of Windows and Linux domain knowledge here as well as a lot of knowledge of Physics, core game logic and low level memory management.
>
> Systems teams will usually be involved at least in some part in each supported OS since most of their projects sit on each OS at a pretty low
> level.
>
> Some things that might fall under a "Systems" team that we break up into separate teams (but our Systems team still interacts with pretty heavily):
>
> - Physics
> - Linux (dedicated server)
> - Direct support for other OSes (iOS/Mac/Consoles/etc)
> - Build Systems
> - Audio
